# FlowOS

Funding coordination platform for ecosystem grants and equity-free funding programs — structured program design, AI-assisted screening, and a registry of funded projects and outcomes.

## The Problem

Ecosystem grant programs have no structured way to define what they're funding before intake opens. Applications arrive with no pre-filtering. Reviews happen against ad-hoc criteria that change every round. When a round closes, there's no record of what the capital actually produced.

Every round is rebuilt from scratch. Performance is invisible. Nothing carries forward.

## What FlowOS Does

FlowOS gives grant operators a connected system for the full funding lifecycle:

- **Program Intent Builder** — Define goals, eligibility, tracks, and KPI metrics before intake opens
- **AI-Assisted Pre-Filtering** — Every application is evaluated against program intent and labelled Pass / Needs Revision / Not a Fit before any human reviews it
- **Structured Review Queue** — Operators and reviewers work from the same rubric every round, with AI pre-scores already surfaced
- **Funding Program Registry** — A structured record of every round, funded project, and outcome — comparable across rounds and programs over time

## Status

Early proof of concept — working prototype with core screens built. Agent pipeline runs on mock outputs. Grant funding wires the live Claude API integration and completes the registry layer.

## Founder

[Feems](founder/founder.md) — funding design researcher and strategist. Background spans the full grants stack as funder, operator, reviewer, researcher, and grantee across Gitcoin, Arbitrum, POKT, and Polygon. FlowOS is the direct product of that research.
