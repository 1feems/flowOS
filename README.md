# Mkondo

Mkondo is a funding coordination and strategy platform for ecosystem grants and other equity-free funding programs — connecting how programs are designed, how applications are evaluated, and what funded projects produce into a coherent whole. Through program design, AI-assisted application evaluation, and a program registry, it serves grant and ecosystem funding operators, growth leads, and treasury committees — giving each the tools to design intentional programs, make informed funding decisions, and understand what capital is producing over time.

## The Problem

- Grant programs have no structured way to capture goals, criteria, and evaluation standards — so every round is rebuilt from scratch and nothing improves over time.
- At volume, reviewing every application manually creates backlogs, inconsistent decisions, and reviewer burnout — with no way to prioritize what's actually worth reading.
- Funding programs across grants, hackathons, and initiatives run in silos — with no shared structure to coordinate what each program is funding or how they fit together.
- Treasuries and funding decision-makers have no structured record linking funding decisions to outcomes — spend data exists but what it produced doesn't, making it difficult to justify budgets or allocate capital with confidence.
- There is no strategy layer above individual programs — no way for ecosystems to compare what different programs produced, identify what's working, and deliberately improve how they deploy capital over time.

## Who It's For

- **Funding Program Operators** — design and run grants and other equity-free funding programs, review applications, and make funding decisions.
- **Foundations & Ecosystem Teams** — coordinate funding programs across grants, hackathons, and initiatives and understand what funded projects are producing.
- **Protocol Treasuries & Governance** — view structured records linking funding spend to outcomes to inform reporting and capital allocation decisions.

## What FlowOS Does

- **Program Intent Builder** — Define program goals, desired outcomes, eligibility criteria, and funding scope before launching a funding round.
- **Structured Application Builder** — Create application forms that are directly aligned with the program's intent, evaluation criteria, and decision rubric.
- **AI-Assisted Pre-Filtering** — Automatically pre-screen incoming applications against program requirements and rubric criteria. Applications are labeled Pass / Needs Revision / Not a Fit before human review.
- **Application Intake & Review** — Collect and review submissions through a structured workflow where applications, rubrics, and AI pre-scores are already surfaced for reviewers.
- **Funding Program Registry** — The coordination and strategy layer. Connects every program, round, funded project, and outcome into a single structured view — so ecosystems can coordinate across all their funding activity, compare what each program produces, and make better capital allocation decisions over time.

## How It Works

1. **Define the Program** — Funding teams configure the program in FlowOS by setting core details such as eligibility, focus areas, desired outcomes, and evaluation criteria.
2. **Configure the Round** — Operators define the round's intent including budget, target applicants, project scope, and the impact metrics the program will track.
3. **Collect Applications** — Builders submit proposals through a public application form generated from the program configuration.
4. **AI-Assisted Evaluation** — Each submission is automatically evaluated against eligibility rules, round goals, expected deliverables, and the scoring rubric, returning a triage label: Pass, Needs Revision, or Not a Fit.
5. **Review & Decision** — Operators review applications in a structured queue with AI summaries and rubric scores surfaced, then approve or reject proposals.
6. **Coordination & Strategy Layer** — Approved projects are added to the registry, building a connected record across all programs and rounds. Ecosystems can see what every program is funding, compare outcomes across rounds and tracks, and allocate capital with confidence — not just spend data, but what it produced.

## Optional Services

Additional services available to support setup, design, and analysis using FlowOS.

- **Program Registry Setup** — Import and structure past grants, hackathons, and funding rounds in FlowOS to create a unified registry of programs and funded projects.
- **Funding Program Design** — Design and configure funding programs in FlowOS, including application forms, evaluation rubrics, builder profiles, and other program assets required to launch a round.
- **Program Assessment & Reporting** — Structure existing funding data in FlowOS and produce reports on program design and funded project outcomes.

## Current Build & Vision

**v1 — Operator Platform for Grant Programs**
The current build is an operator platform for ecosystem grant programs — program setup, AI-assisted application screening, structured review, and a funded project registry.

**Designed for more than grants**
Grants are the first program type. The architecture is built to support any structured funding program — hackathons, bounties, RFPs, and ecosystem initiatives. The operator layer is the entry point; the registry is what turns individual program activity into ecosystem-level coordination and strategy data over time.

**Agent pipeline**
The current agent pipeline pre-screens applications against program intent. It is designed to support additional AI interactions within the funding workflow as the platform grows.
