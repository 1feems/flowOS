# Mkondo

Mkondo is a funding coordination and strategy platform for ecosystem grants and other equity-free funding programs — connecting how programs are designed, how applications are evaluated, and what funded projects produce into a coherent whole. Through program design, AI-assisted application evaluation, and a program registry, it serves grant and ecosystem funding operators, growth leads, and treasury committees — giving each the tools to design intentional programs, make informed funding decisions, and understand what capital is producing over time.

## The Problem

Funding programs often begin without a structured way to translate ecosystem strategy into clear program goals, criteria, and evaluation standards.

Grants, hackathons, and builder initiatives are designed independently, with no shared structure connecting how they contribute to ecosystem priorities.

As application volume grows, programs lack a structured way to surface the submissions most aligned with program intent before human review.

Information about funded projects, milestones, and results is scattered across tools and teams rather than captured in a shared program record.

Ecosystems lack a strategy layer across funding programs to compare outcomes, identify what works, and improve how capital is deployed over time.

## What Mkondo Does

- **Program Design** — Capture program details and intent before a round opens — what's being funded, who it's for, what success looks like, and what metrics will be tracked. Everything downstream is grounded in that structure.
- **Structured Application Builder** — Create application forms that are directly aligned with the program's intent, evaluation criteria, and decision rubric.
- **AI-Assisted Pre-Filtering** — The AI filtering agent pre-screens every incoming application against the specific goals, eligibility criteria, and rubric configured for that program — not a generic checklist. Each submission is labeled Pass / Needs Revision / Not a Fit before it reaches human review. Operators focus on the most aligned applications, and applicants get a faster, more consistent response.
- **Application Intake & Review** — Collect and review submissions through a structured workflow where applications, rubric scores, and AI summaries are already surfaced for reviewers.
- **Funding Program Registry** — The coordination and strategy layer. Connects every program, round, funded project, and outcome into a single structured view — surfacing the program impact metrics defined in the program intent form, so ecosystems can coordinate across all their funding activity, compare what each program produces, and allocate capital to what's working.

## Who It's For

- **Funding Program Operators** — design and run grants and other equity-free funding programs, review applications, and make funding decisions.
- **Foundations & Ecosystem Teams** — coordinate funding programs across grants, hackathons, and initiatives and understand what funded projects are producing.
- **Protocol Treasuries & Governance** — view structured records linking funding spend to outcomes to inform reporting and capital allocation decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Define the Program** — Funding teams configure the program in Mkondo by setting core details such as eligibility, focus areas, desired outcomes, and evaluation criteria.
2. **Configure the Round** — Operators define the round's intent including budget, target applicants, project scope, and the impact metrics the program will track.
3. **Collect Applications** — Applicants submit proposals through a public application form generated from the program configuration.
4. **AI-Assisted Evaluation** — Each submission is automatically evaluated against eligibility rules, round goals, expected deliverables, and the scoring rubric, returning a triage label: Pass, Needs Revision, or Not a Fit.
5. **Review & Decision** — Operators review applications in a structured queue with AI summaries and rubric scores surfaced, then approve or reject proposals.
6. **Coordination & Strategy Layer** — Approved projects are added to the registry, building a connected record across all programs and rounds. Ecosystems can see what every program is funding, compare outcomes across rounds and tracks, and allocate capital with confidence — not just spend data, but what it produced.

## Optional Services

Additional services available to support setup, design, and analysis using Mkondo.

- **Program Registry Setup** — Import and structure past grants, hackathons, and funding rounds in Mkondo to create a unified registry of programs and funded projects.
- **Funding Program Design** — Design and configure funding programs in Mkondo, including application forms, evaluation rubrics, builder profiles, and other program assets required to launch a round.
- **Program Assessment & Reporting** — Structure existing funding data in Mkondo and produce reports on program design and funded project outcomes.

## Current Build & Vision

**v1 — Coordination & Strategy Platform for Grant Programs**
The current build covers the full operator flow for ecosystem grant programs — program design and intent configuration, vertical-specific application forms, AI-assisted pre-screening, structured review, and a funded project registry. The Consumer/Wallet vertical is live and tested. The DeFi/Protocols vertical form and rubric are built and ready to activate.

**Designed for more than grants**
Grants are the first program type. The architecture is built to support any structured funding program — hackathons, bounties, RFPs, and ecosystem initiatives. The operator layer is the entry point; the registry is what turns individual program activity into ecosystem-level coordination and strategy data over time.

**Agent pipeline**
The current agent pipeline pre-screens applications against program intent — returning a triage label, rubric scores, strengths, risks, and AI summary grounded in what the program was designed to fund. It is designed to support additional AI interactions within the funding workflow as the platform grows.

## Founder

[Feems](founder/founder.md) — funding design researcher and strategist focused on how decentralized ecosystems structure and deploy non-dilutive capital. Background spans the full grants stack as funder, operator, reviewer, researcher, and grantee across Gitcoin, Arbitrum, POKT, and Polygon. Mkondo is the direct product of that research and experience.
